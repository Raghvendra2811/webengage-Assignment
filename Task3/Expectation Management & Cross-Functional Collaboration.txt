1.What will be your approach to solving this issue? Explain your strategy and approach to
this?


Ans:-Given the conflicting priorities of Task 1 and Task 2, my approach would be to prioritize Task 2 over Task 1. Since Task 2 is for a priority customer whose campaign needs to go live in the next 2 days, it is imperative that I ask for an extension for this task. I would communicate the situation to the customer and request for an extension, explaining the family emergency and the fact that it is beyond my control. If necessary, I would offer to work extra hours or find alternative solutions to ensure the prompt completion of Task 2. In the meantime, I would prioritize my efforts towards completing Task 1 within the original due date or as soon as possible.


2.How will you inform the 2 separate account managers of both customers about your
approach? Write an internal message informing Manoj (Account manager for Task 1) &
Ravi (Account Manager for Task 2) about your respective approach.


Ans:-
Subject: Update on Task 1 and Task 2 Due Dates

Dear Manoj and Ravi,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to update you on the status of Task 1 and Task 2 that are due tomorrow. Unfortunately, I have a family emergency that requires my immediate attention and will prevent me from meeting the original due dates for both tasks.

As per our previous discussion, I can only ask for an extension for one task and I have decided to prioritize Task 2, which is for your customer Ravi. I understand the importance of this task and the tight timeline for the campaign go-live, and I will do my best to complete it as soon as possible.

In this regard, I have requested an extension for Task 2 and I will keep you updated on its progress. I will also work extra hours, if needed, to ensure that the task is completed on time.

In the meantime, I will continue to work on Task 1 and I will do my best to complete it within the original due date or as soon as possible.

Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions. I apologize for any inconvenience caused and I thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Raghvendra Singh


3.How will you communicate the delay of additional 3 days to the customer? (Write an
email to the customer informing them about this).


Ans:- Subject: Update on Task 2 Delivery Schedule

Dear Ankit,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide an update on the status of Task 2, which was originally due tomorrow.

Unfortunately, I have a family emergency that requires my immediate attention and will prevent me from meeting the original due date. Despite my best efforts, I anticipate a delay of at least 3 more days in completing Task 2.

Please be assured that I am taking this matter seriously and I am doing everything I can to minimize the impact of this delay on your campaign go-live schedule. I have requested an extension for this task and I will continue to work extra hours, if needed, to ensure that it is completed on time.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I understand the importance of meeting your timeline. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter further and to find a solution that meets your needs.

Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions. I am available at your convenience to discuss this further.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

Raghvendra Singh
